Word: 从上到下采取监督机制。老百姓监督政府，政府服务与老百姓。首先从政府的最下面社区开始。社区每个月给本社区的所有家庭开一次会，问问每个家庭有没有什么困难或什么矛盾。有问题即时解决。不好的市民则由社区给予公开批评教育。然后社区人员如不能让老百姓满意，将由老百姓投票解聘社区人员。并在下岗失业人员中重选社区服务人员。这样社会的最基本矛盾就解决了。然后政府也一级一级的效仿社区与百姓的关系。这样国家与社会就变成了一个和谐的社会与大家庭。百姓在这样的国家里都觉得自己有尊严与自豪感。国家一旦有难，国家自动的就会出现一方有难八方支援的场面。爱国、爱家变会成为人们的向往与心底里的共鸣。民族自豪感由然而生。

Word: ，而只是指出有选举并不一定是体现民主全部的标准。就连独裁的共产国家都有选举，难道我们就此认定它们是民主制吗？选举应是民权和民意的体现。如果有一半的选民没法行使他们的投票权，那这选举制度怎么可能真正体现民权呢？如果有四成的选民的政治意愿无法在这选举制度中得到应有的代表，这又怎么可能完整的体现民意的动向呢？

Word: 酒店房租稅也不應豁免，因為影響房租高低的關鍵因素，是酒店房間與遊客數量的供求關係。政府下年度在勾地表提供10幅土地，限作酒店之用，已經是輔助酒店業發展，酒店房間增加更有利於紓緩房租上升的壓力；而且，豁免房租稅之後，酒店業者會否減低房租，使旅客得益，令人懷疑；如果減了稅而需求還是一樣殷切，房租仍會增加。對香港而言，豁免了這個稅種，稅基卻即時進一步收窄了。

Word: 「两岸和平与发展」不仅是台湾朝野政党的共同目标，也是两岸共同的语言与价值，但是如何达成这项目标，却有不同的构想。陈水扁总统在2000年当选总统演说中便向中国政府提议，两岸在没有前提的情况下进行和平协议的谈判，2003年以后更进一步提出两岸建立和平稳定互动架构。然而，中国国民党与中国政府却认为两岸应该在所谓的「1992年共识」与「一个中国原则」基础上达成和平协定。

Word: 台湾虽是五权宪法的制度，但由于过往实行的戒严期，这制度并没有真正体现五权分立的理念，也缺乏实践的空间。这也是为什么我在前文强调民主理念必须在宪法和执行彻底贯彻的原因。台湾现在的政治乱象其实是由一个集权极端反弹过到另一个极端所造成的。这好比法国的革命一样，搞了百年才稳定下来。我绝对不愿看到这种政治极端反射发生在新加坡，所以才希望我们能逐渐走向成熟的民主制度。
